- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @azhara001
- ðŸ‘€ I am a Grad Student at University of California Berkeley where I am focusing on machine learning and data science 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning geo-spatial data visualization in python using Origin-Destination (OD) matrices retrived through the Google Maps Platform
-  :national_park: Aspiring to form an intersection between Data Science, Machine Learning and Visualizations
- :computer: Please connect for gaining access to my Google Maps Platform repository that is built around obtaining Dynamic Travel Times along with Lat_Lng pairs and Geocoding followed by multimodal analysis of these travel times to compute traffic congestions and predict traffic flows!
:student: An interesting snippet of what I do: :call_me_hand:
